1. To install the chart:

```
   helm install gh-runner ./helm -n gh-runner \
   --create-namespace \
   --values ./helm/values.yaml \
   --set secrets.GITHUB_PAT='YOUR_GH_PAT'
```

2. This chart creates:
    1. Deployment - pods containing the GitHub Runner on a UBI image
    2. Secret - Runner configurations that get used as Environment variables to Deployment pods
    3. ServiceAccount and Role/RoleBinding scoped to the release namespace which grant access to Tekton resources (pipelineruns, taskruns, pipelines, tasks) and related core resources (pods, secrets, serviceaccounts, configmaps).
